###  Introduction

As the digital marketplace continues to evolve rapidly, staying ahead of trends is crucial for sellers, marketers, and stakeholders in e-commerce. This project presents a comprehensive analysis of ShopSphere’s e-commerce sales data (2023–2024), uncovering key performance metrics, customer behavior, and growth opportunities within Nigeria’s e-commerce ecosystem.
